Arrays : is used to store multiple values of similar data types: 
because let's say if want to store 5 employees 

In c# we have different data types  
string emp1 ="Niti";
string emp2 ="Jatin";

So array is a reference data type to store the fixed number of elements of the 
same data type. these are stored contiguously in the memory; (array is the data structure)

string[,] students = new Student[3,2];
{
 0,0      0,1
{"Niti" , 23},
1,0       1,1
{"Jatin" ,34},
{"Sakshi",26}
}


class  is just a blue print or a template for defining the properties , attributes and methods 
& Object --- We can access those properties , attributes and methods via creating an object of that class
// in array we were storing similar data of single primitive type
// in object we can store different data type of values (like int , string , boolean , char)
properties in C#

class Student
{
   // attributes of a classes  we call it as encapsulation means (hidden)
    private string name;
    private string age=18;

// to access private data members of a class we use get and set and those are public

    public string Name{

       get{return name;}
       set{name = value;}
    }

    or you can define it as

    public string Name{get; set;};


}
// you have to store 5 objects of a student class having name , age and marks  
//you want to store;


class Student{


public string Name{get; set;}
public int Age{get; set;}
public int[] subjectMarks{get; set;}


}



Student s = new Student();
// Here Student is a class and we are creating or initializing an object using new 
keyword of that class where we have one implicit constructor will be invoked to 
provide the memory of the properties and setting the default values in it 
int =0
name = null;
s = null;
Student[0]  = new Student();
Student[1] = new Student();
Student[i]

int[] stud = new int[5];
stud[0] =10;
